# I have a question
If you have a question, please review the relevant project documentation, and
search/browse existing issues and discussions.

# How can I contribute

## Report a bug
To report a bug, please use the `bug` issue template to open an issue that details the bug
that was encountered.
Please provide as much detail as possible, covering things such as:
- The `avr-libcpp` version (Git commit SHA)
- Description of expected behavior, and observed behavior
- Relevant code and steps required to reproduce the bug
- References to any relevant product pages, data sheets, application notes, and/or other
  documentation from the hardware manufacturer

If the bug report can be verified, the changes required to fix the bug will be captured in
the issue in preparation for implementing the bug fix.

## Implement a bug fix
Issues for implementing bug fixes can be found by looking for issues with the `type-bug`
type label and `status-awaiting_development` status label.
To implement a bug fix, please open a draft pull request that references the associated
issue and implement the bug fix.
Please mark the pull request as "Ready for review" and request a review when the pull
request is ready for a review.
If changes are requested, please discuss and/or address the review findings before
requesting a new review.

- The use case(s) for the enhancement
- Description of current behavior, and how it will change
- References to any relevant product pages, data sheets, application notes, and/or other
  documentation from the hardware manufacturer

If the request for the enhancement to the existing feature is accepted, issue(s) for
designing or implementing the enhancement will be created as appropriate.

## Design an enhancement to an existing feature
To design an enhancement to an existing feature, please use the `enhancement-design` issue
template to open an issue that details the design.

# Style guide
C++ source code is formatted using `clang-format`.
Non-inline comments use a column limit of 90, but this is not enforced by clang-format.
The `format` script in the `ci` directory can be used to run `clang-format` on all C++
source code in the repository.
See the `format` script's help text for usage details.
```shell
./ci/format --help
```

Formatting for all source code and content that is not C++ is neither automated nor
documented (with the exception of a column limit) at this time.
Please use a column limit of 90 for source code and content that is not C++.
Please imitate the formatting of existing source code and content when adding or modifying
source code or content that is not C++.

All non-formatting style issues are neither enforced via automation nor documented at this
time.
Please imitate existing source code and content when adding or modifying source code or
content.
